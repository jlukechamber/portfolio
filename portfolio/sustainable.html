                <p style="text-align: left;">Capitalism and sustainability are incongruent concepts.
                    The former is based on infinite growth through resource consumption, while the latter on human
                    systems being in
                    balance with the finite capacities of our earth. For many years, the narrative around sustainability
                    was
                    focused on individual choice. Thankfully there has been a shift toward recognizing the structures in
                    place
                    that limit our agency to affect change for a sustainable future. Thanks to the work of environmental
                    activists
                    and scholars, most people today understand that auto, energy, and tech companies bear most of the
                    responsibility,
                    rather than individuals choosing which car to drive, or where to spend their money. With income
                    inequality at an
                    all-time high, the economic situation of most prevents us from even making meaningful choices in
                    this realm.
                    This shift in consciousness often manifests in feelings of powerlessness. Indeed, if there are
                    overbearing
                    structural forces minimizing our individual agency, it is easy and perhaps even logical to conclude
                    “what’s the
                    point in doing anything?” or “what can I even do”?

                    <br>To reclaim our agency in sustainability we must first identify gaps in the structures.
                    The coronavirus pandemic has rekindled a desire for sustainability that is beginning to bubble
                    beneath
                    the surface in the form of community gardens, free markets, cooperative living and working, mutual
                    aid
                    and solidarity networks, public transportation, and biking infrastructure. These community
                    economies,
                    counter to the hegemonic capitalist economy, are already functioning here in Madison and are at the
                    core of
                    what a sustainable future will look like. As we continue to see the simultaneous collapse of
                    economic, political,
                    and ecological systems, we must foster existing community economies and build new resilient ones for
                    the future.

                    <br>Thus, the goal of this project was to summarize the existing sustainability networks and
                    community
                    economies in Madison. I did this by creating a paper pamphlet that identifies neighborhoods in the
                    city where
                    it is easiest to live sustainably and summarizes relevant locations for community economies in a
                    poster-sized
                    map intended to be hung on the wall. Currently all this information exists online on different city
                    websites
                    and data hubs. To my knowledge, this data has never been compiled in this way. It hasn’t been
                    brought offline
                    into a pamphlet to serve as a guide to these resources and to invite people to think about how to
                    build new ones.

                    I plan to ride the bike routes and explore parks this summer to verify the GIS data and
                    add more context to the routes and parks I’ve mapped. I am also planning to bring the finished
                    pamphlet to
                    the city and other potentially interested groups, with the goal of having copies printed and
                    distributed at libraries,
                    community centers, farmers’ markets, etc. I am excited and hopeful about the next steps for the
